    <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
    <p> I am a conscientious and professional person with teaching, clerical, and extensive retail experience.
        I am highly organised and efficient. These are characteristics that I strongly believe have led to me
        being considered an excellent worker in the eyes of employers, customers, and even students wherever
        I have worked. My proudest professional achievement so far, was working for a 
        language school in Japan. I learnt a lot during my time there, especially with regard to independent
        work and operating in unfamiliar conditions. I am very excited to apply myself and the skills I have 
        acquired to my next challenge in the sphere of web development. </p>
